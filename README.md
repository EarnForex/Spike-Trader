# Spike Trader

**Warning! This expert advisor can lose all your money! Test it on demo! Apply on live account at your own risk only!**

Spike Trader is a custom MT4/MT5 expert advisor coded by EarnForex.com. It is based on the strategy that was first proposed in the May 2012 issue of the now-defunct _Currency Trader_ magazine. The main idea of its strategy is to detect spikes and trade in the opposite direction.

The EA showed some interesting long-term profit on USD/CAD @ D1 backtests.
